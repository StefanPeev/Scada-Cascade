# Scada | Cascade

Open-source font by Jovanny Lemonad

In 2005, Scada was designed as the corporate identity font for the Latvian design studio Scada.lv. In 2011 the design studio decided to make Scada a libre font. Over 6 months the font was reworked, improved and expanded into a family. It has a modern style, specifically designed for small sizes.

A new approach in development of the project is connected with local Cyrillic forms for Bulgarian, Serbian and North Macedonian languages. To make a difference between the original project and the new one the latest will be developed under the name Cascade.

### version 4.001
