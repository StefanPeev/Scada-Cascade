# Scada | Cascade

**Cascade** is a part of the project **LOCAL FONTS** for development of <code>free-to-use fonts</code> with the *modern Bulgarian letterform model* in the Cyrillic Unicode range. The project as a whole is based on well known fonts published under licenses which permit modifications and derivative works.
The Cascade font family is based on the Scada font family, issued by Jovanny Lemonad, copyright(c) 2008-2012, under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL), version 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/ofl).

In 2005, Scada was designed as the corporate identity font for the Latvian design studio Scada.lv. In 2011 the design studio decided to make Scada a libre font. Over 6 months the font was reworked, improved and expanded into a family. It has a modern style, specifically designed for small sizes.

A new approach in development of the project is connected with local Cyrillic forms for Bulgarian, Serbian and North Macedonian languages. To make a difference between the original project Scada and the new one the latest will be developed under the name Cascade.

### Cascade version 4.101
